        <h1>Wearable technology</h1>
        <p>Wearable technology is any technology that is designed to be used while worn. Common types of wearable technology include smartwatches, fitness trackers, and smartglasses. Wearable electronic devices are often close to or on the surface of the skin, where they detect, analyze, and transmit information such as vital signs, and/or ambient data and which allow in some cases immediate biofeedback to the wearer. Wearable devices collect vast amounts of data from users making use of different behavioral and physiological sensors, which monitor their health status and activity levels. Wrist-worn devices include smartwatches with a touchscreen display, while wristbands are mainly used for fitness tracking but do not contain a touchscreen display.</p>
        <p>Wearable devices such as activity trackers are an example of the Internet of things, since "things" such as electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity are effectors that enable objects to exchange data (including data quality) through the internet with a manufacturer, operator, and/or other connected devices, without requiring human intervention. Wearable technology offers a wide range of possible uses, from communication and entertainment to improving health and fitness, however, there are worries about privacy and security because wearable devices have the ability to collect personal data.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In the 1500s, German inventor Peter Henlein (1485â€“1542) created small watches that were worn as necklaces. A century later, pocket watches grew in popularity as waistcoats became fashionable for men. Wristwatches were created in the late 1600s but were worn mostly by women as bracelets.</p>
        <p>Pedometers were developed around the same time as pocket watches. The concept of a pedometer was described by Leonardo da Vinci around 1500, and the Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg has a pedometer in its collection from 1590.</p>
        <p>In the late 1800s, the first wearable hearing aids were introduced.</p>
        <p>In 1904, aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont pioneered the modern use of the wristwatch.</p>
        <p>In 1949, American biophysicist Norman Holter invented the very first health monitoring device. His invention, the Holter monitor, was groundbreaking as one of the first wearable devices capable of tracking vital health data outside of a clinical setting.</p>
        <p>In the past, individuals relied on their own senses to detect health issues and sought medical attention accordingly. However, individual health awareness is diminishing as modern lifestyles become increasingly hectic and stressful. According to a survey conducted by Talker Research for MD Live, 59% of women ignore early signs of potential health problems, and 66% delay action until symptoms disrupt their daily routine. Being preoccupied with work and daily tasks, many people overlook warning signs that could lead to serious health issues. This decline in awareness is largely due to our dependence on fast-paced routines and a lack of time for self-care. Fortunately, wearable AI technology offers a promising solution by monitoring real-time health data and alerting users to abnormal signs. Designed to support proactive healthcare, these devices help individuals make informed decisions before it is too late. While our natural ability to sense health changes may be fading, technology is stepping in to fill the gap effectively. By embracing these innovations, we can maintain control over our well-being in a world where personal awareness is gradually disappearing.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>Wearable technology has a variety of use cases which is growing as the technology is developed and the market expands. It can be used to encourage individuals to be more active and improve their lifestyle choices. Healthy behavior is encouraged by tracking activity levels and providing useful feedback to enable goal setting. This can be shared with interested stakeholders such as healthcare providers.</p>
        <p>In professional sports, wearable technology has applications in monitoring and real-time feedback for athletes. Examples of wearable technology in sport include accelerometers, pedometers, and GPS's which can be used to measure an athlete's energy expenditure and movement pattern.</p>
        <p>In cybersecurity and financial technology, secure wearable devices have captured part of the physical security key market. McLear, also known as NFC Ring, and VivoKey developed products with one-time pass secure access control.</p>
